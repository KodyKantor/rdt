# rdt - rust dtrace integration

This is very much just a POC.

# Building

There's a simple makefile that will build libusdt and then use some env vars
to make sure Cargo notices it.

```
make
```

If you're modifying libusdt, you'll need to run `make clean`, or at least
`cargo clean` before running `make` again. Cargo will not notice if a linked
library is updated.

# Running:
```
$ dtrace -Z -n 'rustprov*:::rustname { printf("%s", copyinstr(arg0))}' -c './target/debug/rdt'
```
